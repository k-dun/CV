## 06 Hobbies

Most of my interest are either tech or tech-adjacent. Here are some of them:

- I obssessively listen to podcasts, such as: "The a16z Podcast" (focued on tech and culture trends, future of software), "Indie Hackers" (interviews with bootstrapped SaaS founders), "My First Million" (lighthearted and entertaining tech entrepreneurship talks, sprinkled with amazing ideas) and "First Mint" (Web3 and sports NFTs covered by LG Doucet and his Dulcet tones).

- Last year I started and ran a newsletter called FUCT (Fairly Unbiased Crypto Thoughts), focused on all things Web3, the Flow blockchain ecosystem in particular. 

- I'm currently in process of launching a blog on how to break into the UK's tech industry (with a working title "0..1: Break Into Tech", a play on Ruby syntax and Peter Thiel's book). Warranted I succeed in this mission myself, I intend to create a resource to help and enable other people switch careers and become software engineers, regardless of their age or previous work experience.

- I love streetwear. In particular the utilitarian and workwear side of fashion, from brands like Acronym and Carhartt. I am also a sneaker addict in recovery.
