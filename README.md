I spend countless hours consuming all content touching on tech, Web3 and start-ups. I am ready and excited to bring my problem-solving mindset, infinite curiosity and hard work to the tech industry.


## Skills

### **Problem-solving.**

> **_"For a successful and fulfilling career, you should do what feels like fun to you and work to others._"** - Shaan Puri

The quote above encapsulates perfectly, how I feel about problem-solving. Regardless, whether it's coding, logistics and management in my previous line of work, cryptographic riddles I used to solve in my teens or doing crosswords with my grandma all the way back in my childhood. 

Nothing brings me more satisfaction than being challenged and overcoming it.

### **Communication.**

> **_"Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply."_** — Stephen R. Covey

I always do my hardest to actively listen to others, ask meaningful questions and clarify information to ensure full understanding of all design decisions and potential issues. I have also always been able to express my thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner. I believe both will be immensely helpful in the field of software engineering, where so often they key is to bring everyone onto the same page, so as to choose the right course of action.

### **Leadership.**

> **_"Earn your leadership every day."_** – Michael Jordan

I successfully managed and lead small teams for over a decade. Always striving to deliver results to exceed all expectations and utilise all my team member's greatest strengths. What made me really successful in this field so far is my ability to simply bring out the best in others, as well as finding the right balance between delegating and actively taking charge of tasks at hand. 

### **Adaptability.**
  
> **_“The wise adapt themselves to circumstances, as water moulds itself to the pitcher.”_** – Chinese Proverb

Throughout my whole life I moved around a lot. It helped me adapt to new environments and new people (even a whole new country) with relative ease. I am used to learning and researching things on the fly, which will make my transition into software engineering a lot easier too. 

After all, tech is an ever-changing industry and the ability to learn new standards or frameworks will be key in becoming a full-rounded software developer. I am always keen to learn and ready to adapt.

## Hobbies

Most of my interest are either tech or tech-adjacent. Here are some of them:

- I obssessively listen to podcasts, such as: "The a16z Podcast" (focued on tech and culture trends, future of software), "Indie Hackers" (interviews with bootstrapped SaaS founders), "My First Million" (lighthearted and entertaining tech entrepreneurship talks, sprinkled with amazing ideas) and "First Mint" (Web3 and sports NFTs covered by LG Doucet and his Dulcet tones).

- Last year I started and ran a newsletter called FUCT (Fairly Unbiased Crypto Thoughts), focused on all things Web3, the Flow blockchain ecosystem in particular. 

- I'm currently in process of launching a blog on how to break into the UK's tech industry (with a working title "0..1: Break Into Tech", a play on Ruby syntax and Peter Thiel's book). Warranted I succeed in this mission myself, I intend to create a resource to help and enable other people switch careers and become software engineers, regardless of their age or previous work experience.

- I love streetwear. In particular the utilitarian and workwear side of fashion, from brands such as Acronym and Carhartt. I am also a sneaker addict in recovery.
